Subject: [PATCH 08/41] drm/msm: rename MSM drm platform driver's name into
 msm_drm

Before this change, the driver's name was defined as "msm". This
definition conflicts with another MSM driver in the downstream
kernel (camera_v2).
To avoid such conflict (kernel crash), the msm drm driver's name
is changed to "msm_drm", which is also a bit more explicit than
the previous definition.
